Delegators are token holders who cannot, or do not want to run a [validator](/docs/validate/glossary#validator) node themselves.

Delegators secure the network by staking with validators. To stake with the validators, delegators pay a [commission](/docs/validate/glossary#commission) to the validator of their choice.

Delegators delegate staking tokens to a validator and obtain a part of their rewards in exchange. Because delegators share rewards with their validators, delegators also share risks. Should a validator misbehave, each of their delegators will be partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stake. Delegators play a critical role in the system, as they are responsible for choosing validators.
